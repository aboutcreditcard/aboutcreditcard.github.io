                      <h2>The Rise of Universal Credit</h2>  <p>Universal Credit (UC) was introduced in the UK in 2013 as a streamlined welfare system designed to replace six existing benefits, including Jobseeker’s Allowance and Housing Benefit. The idea was simple: simplify the process, reduce bureaucracy, and encourage employment. Yet, from the beginning, UC faced criticism for its slow rollout, administrative errors, and harsh sanctions.  </p>  <h3>A System Built on Austerity</h3>  <p>The early 2010s were marked by austerity measures following the 2008 financial crisis. UC was born in this era, with the promise of making welfare more efficient. However, critics argued that its real purpose was to cut costs. The five-week waiting period for the first payment left many claimants in financial distress, pushing some toward food banks and payday loans.  </p>  <h3>The Human Cost</h3>  <p>Stories quickly emerged of families struggling under UC’s rigid structure. Single parents, disabled individuals, and low-income workers found themselves trapped in a system that often seemed designed to punish rather than support. The digital-only application process excluded those without internet access, while sanctions for minor infractions—like missing an appointment—left vulnerable people without income for weeks.  </p>  <h2>The Benefit Freeze: A Policy of Deprivation</h2>  <p>While UC was being implemented, another policy was quietly squeezing household budgets: the benefit freeze. Introduced in 2016, it froze most working-age benefits for four years, meaning payments did not rise with inflation.  </p>  <h3>The Impact on Poverty</h3>  <p>By 2020, the freeze had effectively cut the real value of benefits by 6%. For families already struggling, this meant impossible choices: heating or eating, rent or medicine. Research showed that child poverty rates climbed, with single-parent households hit hardest. Food bank usage soared, and homelessness increased—clear signs of a welfare system failing its most vulnerable.  </p>  <h3>Political Backlash and Public Outcry</h3>  <p>The benefit freeze became a symbol of austerity’s cruelty. Charities, activists, and opposition politicians condemned it, arguing that it punished the poor for economic problems they didn’t create. Even some Conservative MPs began to distance themselves from the policy as public anger grew.  </p>  <h2>Universal Credit During the Pandemic</h2>  <p>When COVID-19 struck, UC suddenly became a lifeline for millions. Overnight, claims surged as people lost jobs or saw incomes collapse. The government temporarily increased UC by £20 a week—a rare admission that pre-pandemic levels were inadequate.  </p>  <h3>A Temporary Reprieve</h3>  <p>The £20 uplift was a game-changer for many, but it was always framed as temporary. When it ended in 2021, households faced an immediate income drop amid rising living costs. Critics called the decision heartless, especially as inflation began to spiral.  </p>  <h2>The Present Crisis: UC in an Age of Inflation</h2>  <p>Today, UC is under even greater strain. Soaring food and energy prices have pushed more people into poverty, while wages fail to keep up. The benefit freeze may be over, but its legacy lingers—UC rates remain far below what’s needed to cover basic living expenses.  </p>  <h3>The Cost-of-Living Emergency</h3>  <p>Families on UC are now choosing between skipping meals or falling behind on bills. Disabled claimants, who often face higher living costs, are particularly affected. Meanwhile, the government insists that work is the best route out of poverty—yet many UC recipients already work but still can’t make ends meet.  </p>  <h3>Calls for Reform</h3>  <p>Activists demand an overhaul: higher payments, an end to sanctions, and a more humane system. Some propose a Universal Basic Income (UBI) as an alternative, arguing that unconditional support would reduce poverty and bureaucracy. Others push for at least restoring the £20 uplift permanently.  </p>  <h2>The Future of Welfare</h2>  <p>The debate over UC and the benefit freeze reflects a deeper question: what kind of society do we want? One where safety nets are strong enough to prevent suffering, or one where welfare is a last resort, riddled with stigma and barriers? As economic uncertainty grows, the answer becomes more urgent.</p>
